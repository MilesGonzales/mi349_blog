            Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.
            Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life…
            He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a 
            pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power,
            which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his
             sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.<br>

            Aikin and Talisse don’t believe that we are able to properly argue these giant points for multiple reasons. Firstly, the issue of
            cognitive command comes into play as we may not have a full grasp on the concept that we argue to begin with. If we do not have a
            successful cognitive command of our argument, how are we ever supposed to successfully argue our points? Secondly is the matter of 
            random luck that may come into play. If someone argues these massive points and for some reason is proven right down the road, they 
            most likely didn’t have the knowledge in which to properly argue these points but rather had a lucky guess. I believe that we do have
            the cognitive ability to argue these points due to the fact that it is healthy for us to consider the opposite of our viewpoints. As
            long as both or all parties engage in an open argument that actually helps others understand one another and not lead to a pseudo
            argument then there is real room for growth in these issues.<br>

            "Who’s joe?" a distant voice asks.
            Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location.
            The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself split open and a horrific creature crawled from the ground, covered in mucus and tar.
            ”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered.
            The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in fear.
            "I did a little trolling." the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth.<br>
