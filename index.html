            Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.<br>
            Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life…<br>
            He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a <br>
            pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power,<br>
            which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his<br>
             sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.<br>

            Aikin and Talisse don’t believe that we are able to properly argue these giant points for multiple reasons. Firstly, the issue of<br> 
            cognitive command comes into play as we may not have a full grasp on the concept that we argue to begin with. If we do not have a<br>
            successful cognitive command of our argument, how are we ever supposed to successfully argue our points? Secondly is the matter of <br>
            random luck that may come into play. If someone argues these massive points and for some reason is proven right down the road, they <br>
            most likely didn’t have the knowledge in which to properly argue these points but rather had a lucky guess. I believe that we do have<br>
            the cognitive ability to argue these points due to the fact that it is healthy for us to consider the opposite of our viewpoints. As<br>
            long as both or all parties engage in an open argument that actually helps others understand one another and not lead to a pseudo<br>
            argument then there is real room for growth in these issues.<br>
