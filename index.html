        Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.<br>
        Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life…<br>
        He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a <br>
        pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power,<br>
        which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his<br>
         sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
